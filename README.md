 <li>Select a good quality image with a good central focal point (e.g. the man and his horse is a great focal point in the example). The focal point could be a person or thing (e.g. car, track athlete, or basketball player).</li>

 <li>Add a motion blur along a path AROUND the focal point (you can add some blur to parts of the focal point if it helps create a better sense of motion).</li>

 <li>Adjust the shape of the blur path.</li>

 <li>Add at least two points on the blur path.</li>

 <li>Please do not merge layers before submitting your composition.</li>

</ol>

<em><strong>NOTE 1:</strong></em> In order to prevent the issue with limited file submission size of LEO, you can upload the files to google drive, one drive, or Dropbox and share the folder for the project with me, and submit the link as a part of your submission.
